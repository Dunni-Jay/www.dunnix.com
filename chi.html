<p> <strong>Eligibility</strong>
<br>
<br>
Candidates who made the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) their Institution of choice and scored a minimum of 180 marks in the 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), which was conducted by the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board (JAMB).
Futa Post Utme form is out, every aspirant is encouraged to go and apply before the dead-line. Every Aspirant should prepare well for the Examination. After JAMB, the next line of action is to enroll for the Post UTME of the school you chose in JAMB, this application can only be done when the Portal for Post UTME application is opened.</p>
<p>Once this portal is opened, registration can be a little difficult, because unlike JAMB, there are no accredited/registration centers where you can just stroll into and get your registration done. So, when will FUTA open the Post UTME Screening portal? FUTA Post UTME Screening portal opening Date is 11th September 2023 to 6th October 2023. Apply for the P.Utme on <a href="http://www.futa.edu.ng/eportals">www.futa.edu.ng/eportals</a>

You will have to fill out the online registration form and upload your O’Level result on the portal as well. Make your payment and make sure your O’Level result is verified. </p>
